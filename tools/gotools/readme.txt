Some remarks about goedit and why it should not be a problem to use dedit for creating go maps

Welcome to the world of Global Operations (GO) world creation. GO uses the Lithtech Talon engine (a modified version of Lithtech 2.4).
The tool used to create GO worlds is a modified version of the Lithtech editor DEdit, that we call GOEdit.
If you have created maps for other first person shooters then you should have little difficulty learning GOEdit.
If you are new to the world of map creation then you have some work ahead of you but with dedication and practise you will be creating worlds in no time.

The following document is a starter guide that will help you get up and running. This guide is intended to get you up and running and introduce you to the basics of world creation including BSP construction, VIS groups, lighting, entities and much more. Good luck and we can't wait to see what you come up with.

GOEdit being a modified version of DEdit, shares a lot of functionality. Check out the DEdit documentation for further reference.
