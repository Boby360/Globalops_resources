<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tutorial 1: Light
spilling out of a doorway as the door opens.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">01	Creating the Door
worldmodel object.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Create a brush to
become the door.  Make sure it’s selected and right click.  Select
“Bind to Object” and choose “Door” from the list of objects.
From the properties tab adjust the properties of the door.  Make sure
the object is selected and go to the properties tab.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a.	State Flags</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The StateFlags control
how the door behaves.  You can get a description of what each
stateflag does by hold the mouse over the stateflag name for a few
seconds.   We want our door to close automatically so we will set the
RemainOpen stateflag to False.  The TriggerClose flag must be set to
False if you want the door to close automatically, setting this flag
to true requires the door to receive another trigger message before
closeting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">b.	OpenWaitTime</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This field defines the
number of seconds after the door is triggered open that it will wait
before it automatically is triggered close.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c.	Move Direction</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The MoveDirection field
is an X Y Z vector.  A 1 will make the door move positive in that
vector and a -1 will make it move negative in that vector.   Example:
 Up would equal “0 1 0” without the quotes.  East would equal “1
0 0”.   North would equal “0 0 1”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">d.	Move Speed</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The movespeed is the
speed you want the door to move in Dedit units per second.  If your
door is 256 tall and you want the door to finish it’s moving in one
second, make this value 256.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">e.	Block Light</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By default this value
is set to False, to have any effect on the lighting we will need this
value set to True.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">f.	ShadowLights</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This field is the name
of the KeyFramerLight object that the door will use.  Since we
haven’t created the KeyFramerLight yet, you should leave this blank
for now, but don’t forget to come back after we create the
KeyFramerLight object and put its name here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">g.	LightFrames</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This is the number of
frames of lightmap animations that the processor should generate for
this door while it is traveling.  The processor will also generate an
additional two frames, one for fully open and one for fully closed. 
The faster your door is moving the less frames of lightmap animations
you will need to make the animation look convincing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">02	Creating the
KeyFramerLight object.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Make sure the door is
now deselected by hitting “U” which will unselect all objects. 
Move the crosshair to where you want to place your KeyFramerLight by
holding down “X”.  Right click and select “Add Object”.  Find
and select “KeyFramerLight”.  Remember to take the name of this
object and place in the ShadowLights field on the Door.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a.	UseShadowMaps.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This value defaults to
True, it lowers the quality of the lightmap animations to make the
.DAT file smaller.   There is a performance penalty and the quality
of the lightmap frames is poor.  It’s recommended that you leave
this at True and change it to False later if you don’t like the way
the light is looking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">b.	Light Radius</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This value controls how
big the radius is on the light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c.	Light Color</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This allows you to
select the color of your light.   
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">03	Processor Settings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a.	Light Animations</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Make sure to set the
Light Animations checkbox on the processor.  Without this box checked
all light animations will not function.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">01	Limitations</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are a few
limitations to this effect.  It doesn’t work well with Lambertian
Lightmapping, which is used to give lights a more natural falloff. It
is also can be a performance hog, depending on the number of lightmap
frames and the number of polys being effected by the light.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tutorial 2: Fan casting
shadow as it rotates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">05	Creating the
RotatingWorldModel for the fan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Build your fan brushes,
then select all of them and right click. Select “Bind to Object”
from the menu.   Choose “RotatingWorldModel” from the list of
objects.  Make sure the object is selected and go to the properties
tab.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a.	Start On</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Setting this to True
will cause the Fan to be rotating by default.  Setting this to False
will require you to send the RotatingWorldModel an ON message before
it will start rotating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">b.	BlockLight</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You must set BlockLight
to True, or the object will not block lighting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c.	RotationAxis</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a floor or ceiling
fan you will want the fan to rotate on the Y-axis, set the
YaxisRevTime to 1, so that it takes one second to revolve a full
revolution around the Y-axis.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">d.	ShadowLights</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This field is the name
of the KeyFramerLight object that the door will use.  Since we
haven’t created the KeyFramerLight yet, you should leave this blank
for now, but don’t forget to come back after we create the
KeyFramerLight object and put its name here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">e.	LightFrames</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This is the number of
frames of lightmap animations that the processor should generate for
this door while it is traveling.  The processor will also generate an
additional two frames.  The faster your RotatingWorldModel is moving
the less frames of lightmap animations you will need to make the
animation look convincing.  Fourteen is enough for a one second
revolution time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">f.	ShadowAxis</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This tells the
processor which axis the shadow will be generated on, for our floor
or ceiling fan example the default will do.  If you change the
rotation axis of the RotatingWorldModel you will also need to change
the ShadowAxis.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">06	Creating the
KeyFramerLight object.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Make sure the door is

Move the crosshair to where you want to place your KeyFramerLight by
holding down “X”.  Right click and select “Add Object”.  Find

True, it must be set to False for this effect to function.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">b.	Light Radius</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This value controls how
big the radius is on the light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c.	Light Color</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This allows you to
select the color of your light</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">07	Processor Settings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a.	Light Animations</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Make sure to set the
Light Animations checkbox on the processor.  Without this box checked
all light animations will not function.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">08	Limitations</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a.	The number of frames
required to make this effect look convincing completely depends on
it’s use.   This can make it difficult to get the effect to look
proper, also this effect doesn’t work well with Lambertian
Lightmapping if the light from the fan effects nearby walls.  You
should probably not use more than fourteen frames, and then not have
very many per level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tutorial 3: Lights that
can be turned on and off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">01	Create the
LightGroups</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Place the crosshair
near where the light will be.  Right click and choose “Add Object”.
 Select the LightGroup object.  Set its color to the color of light
you want to affect the models in the level.   It’s very important
that you place it near where the light source will be or the model
lighting might look strange.  Make sure the object is selected and go
to the properties tab.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a.	StartOn</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Setting this to True
will make the light start on by default, Setting this to False will
make the light start off by default. We want this set to True for
this tutorial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">02	Adding lights to
LightGroups.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Select the LightGroup
object in the node tree and hit F3.  This makes this node the active
parent node. Any new objects or brushes will be created under this
node.   Make your lights as you normally would, when you are done be
sure to set the active parent back to the main node or you might
accidentally place objects other than lights into the LightGroup. 
It’s important to know that the ONLY thing that can be in a
LightGroup node is Lights and DirLights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a.	Light Objects</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Be sure to set
LightObjects to False on all light objects placed in a LightGroup
leaving this as True will cause performance problems.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">b.	Light Radius</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This value sets the
radius of the light in world units.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c.	Light Color</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The value sets the
color of the light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">d.	Light BrightScale</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The brightness of the
light, any value can be used but values between 0.25 and 1.0 are the
most commonly used.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">03	Creating the switch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Create a brush, which
will become your switch.  Make sure it’s selected and right click
and choose “Bind to Object”.  Select “Switch” from the object
list. There are several values, which control the function of the
switch, but the following are the ones that you will need to adjust
to get it working.   
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a.	OnTrigger Target.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Set this field to the
name of your LightGroup object.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">b.	OnTrigger Message.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">LightGroups respond to
the ON and OFF messages.  If the LightGroup is to set to start on,
then set this string to OFF.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c.	OffTrigger Target.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Set this field once
again to the name of the LightGroup object.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">d.	OffTrigger Message.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Again, the valid
messages are ON and OFF.  Set this value to ON if the lightgroup is
setup to start on.</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">02	Creating the
TranslucentWorldModel for the Light Fixture.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Build a brush for your
