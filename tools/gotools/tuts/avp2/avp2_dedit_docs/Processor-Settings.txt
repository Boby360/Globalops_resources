PROCESSOR SETTINGS ADDENDUM
===========================

Project Directory:

    If AVP2 is installed in a folder with long file names, you will
    need to use the 8-character DOS shortcut for the name. For
    instance, if you installed the game to the default directory,
    you would want to put the following in this field:

    c:\progra~1\fox\aliens~1.pre\avp2

    You can get the 8-character DOS shortcut for the path names
    with the "dir" command in the Windows Command Prompt window.


Options/Extra Parameters:

	-leakfile <name>.lek

	This writes a leak file to:		\AVP2\DEDIT\*.lek
	One is for the physics shell: 		<name>.lek
	The other is for the visual shell:	<name>_Vis.lek

		TIPS:
		Hide all Detail Brushes (Selection/Select Detail Brushes)
		Hide all TranslucentWorldObjects (Selection/Advanced Select/Node of Class)
		Hide all Doors (Selection/Advanced Select/Node of Class)
		Make sure *NO* NOSNAP=TRUE geometry is touching the outer shell of your level!

	-nosnapnocsg

	Use this flag when processing levels that have single-sided geometry that is not
	bound to any object. You will need to use it with the included Sample_Marine and
	Sample_Alien levels, for instance, to avoid getting leaks.


Options/Slider Reference:

	If you have a leak, try sliding the processor bar to LESS POLIES or to BALANCED TREE.
