Ok so it was not possible to import non GlobalOps Models into the editor.Kind of annoyance for me so i searched and searched cam to conclusion nobody likes the engine not much info found.
But I found a simple way of doing it. Im sure there an even simpler way to do this but I had to do it this way ;)
I successfully imported NOLF 'No one lives forever' models into goedit.

Requirements:

GoEditor
Noesis	http://oasis.xentax.com/index.php?content=home
Noesis Lithtech Import Export python plugin	http://xtsukihime.wordpress.com/noesis-plugins/
If you like Download DTX plugin too (But it does not work that good..)
Some model you want to use .ABC file and .DTX textures


Open up model in noesis (If you added DTX plugin you can see th textured Model BUT only if dtx is in same folder..)
Select FILE -> EXPORT

In 'Main output type:' select '.obj WaveFront OBJ'
Everything else don't touch (or?..)

You should also select the right filename Extension 'OBJ' and directory where to save the file under 'BROWSE'
Hit OK and it should convert the .ABC Lithtech model to .OBJ Wavefront model

Hit up GOedit as usual blabla open project globalops.dep new world bla

now select 'Add Object' from worlds tab or from drop down selection box.
Select 'PROP'
Now on left side select 'properties' tab and change 
	FILENAME to the .ABC model
	SKIN0 to the Models DTX texture
	PlaceHolder to the models 'OBJ' file

Thats it your model should appear in editor

PS: 
.abc Models go into /MODELS
.dtx Textures /skins
.obj File into /MODELS
